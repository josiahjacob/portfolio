        <p>Memories are often the milestones we have left behind in  the journey of life. When you find one of these milestone you get to relieve the whole scenario and to wish you have a TIMEMACHINE ! I am now knocking every doors of my mind and peeping through the different keyholes for one of the beautiful memory so that I can  share them to you and to cherish them more and more. Some incidents may be filled with tension and sorrow when that have been happened to you, but later all seems to be like a TRAGEDY TO COMEDY memories that makes you laugh when you think about it, so I thought I want you to know about the memory that wasn't so beautiful when that happened to you but have become beautiful as time gone by...   Have you ever thought carelessness can ever become one of your beautiful memory? It has happened to me. Read to find it out. </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 1 🏫</h2>
        <h5>The school bell rings 📣📣</h5>
        <p>And the last period is over now comes the time for our next destination, Tution classes.Despite of our study schedules and classes what we love was the time we get in between school to tuition, some may be like the buzzing bees who FOCUS on how to reach there faster or to catch the first bus, we (ya I too have some people of same mental disorder called besties ) were not among them. We were the nature lovers, who take time to enjoy the scenes throughout the journey so sometimes we were like street boys who run and catch others in road sometimes like psychos, (Seeing us at that time seems what's just opposite to what we were ,the CBSE students ) </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/image_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        </p>
        <p>We prefer the road less (not)taken,we have options so we decided to take the road that's next to spinning mill, and as usual the buses didn't stop because of us (fear of Student's Tickets ),And we waited like hell, no buses are coming and that too if came it wouldn't stop seeing us,(in Keala, if you travel by the bus as a student you would know the difficulties of travelling in a bus and that too in a private one you would be the security of footboard)....</p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 2 🚎</h2>
        <h5>Bus stop near the spinning mill </h5>
        <p>The time was running fastly and and that day I have an additional cover to hold comprising of assignment books and note of 6 or 7 subjects and my friends were taking turns to hold that, too heavy. (We didnt forget to get some chocolates even when we were late), Finally we thought our decision was so wrong and we decided to walk to next bus stop (the one which we avoided cause of too many students,in the hope of getting a seat cause this was the first stop )We walked through the highway </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 3 </h2>
        <h5>The next bus stop🚍</h5>
        <p>And reached next stop and were getting a bit nervous cause it's been an hour, there too disappointment waited us all,(Can you imagine not getting a bus in a HIghway!!),We confirmed the probability of getting scolding from our tutor, so I accompanied by two of my friends crossed the road to call an auto for 5 of us (it would be around 60 or something instead of free Student's Ticket ) </p>
        <p>But we didnt have option, and when we were discussing about the fare with the auto driver,<h6>LOOK WHO CAME ! </h6></p>
        <p>The great KSRTC (Our own anavandi), and the other two who were on the opposite side has stopped the bus and was yelling for us, Somehow we managed to cross the road and finally catch the BUS without getting hit by vehicles(Thank God!). We didnt mind how crowded the bus was,It was like getting some water on a hot dessert,And I gave the cover containing books to an aunty who was sitting and when I thought all the tension was over I began chitchating with friends and was looking at the watch and noticed some of our classmates was also in that bus and we reached the stop near the police station. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 4</h2>
          <h5>Stop near the police station 👮‍♂️ </h5>
          <p>I got down and was speeding to reach our class,then one of my friend enquired about the books that I carried, <br><h6>TOTAL PANIC</h6><br>I dont know what went blank! (Me?My mind?or whole Earth?) 
          <br>I dont know what to do!.Just then the tears started rolling down my eyes, That assignment books were the result of my whole nights and notebooks too, I can't rewrite it, At that time you realise what friends were meant for they helped me to calm down and cheered up that we can get that we can get that books back !I didn't realised I walked from there to tution and was mumbling and weeping the whole walk </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 5</h2>
          <h5>TUITION CENTRE 👨‍🏫 </h5>
          <p>When I saw our tutor there, I couldn't stop holding back my tears, that made him enquire about what happened,I told him I can't loose that books!! <br> He also encouraged me and said no to worry.He asked the whole class especially vimalites who travelled in the same bus about the ticket, We usually tear the tickets into pieces and blow them away, and everybody searched bag and pockets, Suprisingly Adwaith,my dearest friend had the ticket in his pocket,he didnt mean to keep it but kept along with the balance coins (Shikkari Shambhu) 
            
            <br>I was so glad and despite of having class, my tutor said we will go to Kollam Ksrtc stand and will find the bus with ticket no. 
            
            <br>I followed and we went in a scooter to Kollam which was approximately 30 km from where we were, (It was like a movie scene) </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 6</h2>
          <h5>KSRTC STAND 👨‍💼  </h5>
          <p>We asked the officer there about the books, he said a lady have given it to them and to show the Id card (I thank my school at that time cause despite of plastic book cover all the details were there in that cover including space for mobile no.) So they have called my mom and informed about the books before we have reached, I thanked all of them especially my tutor who took me here to get my books back! And the way back he mocked how I cried .. </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 7</h2>
          <h5>Tution class 👨‍🏫👭 </h5>
          <p>WE reached the tution centre and I entered the class and as soon as I looked to my friends eyes I understand how much worried they were just like me!! I joined them and the class kept going.... </p>      
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scene 8</h2>
          <h5>Caught in the memory 🧚‍♀️</h5>
          <p>What if it was a usual day like the rest? What if we havent missed the bus,books? 

           <br>I wouldn't remember that particular day like this, It was just like an adventure, chasing my books back. These make this incident A BEAUTIFUL MEMORY to me!! 
            
            <br>This may be just an incident to an outsider, but for the people who have been at that particular time know that it have became a page in my book of memories, And now I have again relived that moment .. </p>
